## What Is Momentum Trading?

Momentum trading is the practice of buying assets that have been rising and selling (or shorting) assets that have been falling, on the premise that **trends tend to persist**.

> **Core question to always be asking:** What is the strength and direction of the current trend?

Crypto markets are particularly well-suited to momentum strategies:

- **Decentralised & unregulated** — no central authority dampening price swings
- **Highly volatile** — frequent news-driven movements create numerous short- and medium-term opportunities
- **Traded 24/7** — trends can develop and accelerate at any hour

> ⚠️ Higher volatility means higher risk. Strict risk management is essential — manual discipline alone is often insufficient at faster timeframes.

## Why It Works

### Behavioural Factors
- **Underreaction** — investors initially underreact to new information (anchoring, conservatism bias), causing prices to drift gradually rather than adjust instantly
- **Herding & FOMO** — later overreaction extends the trend further before eventual mean reversion

### Structural Factors
- Trend-following funds and systematic CTAs mechanically buy rising / sell falling assets
- Stop-loss cascades and liquidations accelerate moves (especially relevant in leveraged crypto markets)
- News coverage and analyst upgrades consistently lag price moves, adding fresh buyers after a trend is underway

### Empirical Backing
Formally documented by Jegadeesh & Titman (1993). Replicated across equities, commodities, currencies, bonds, and crypto. Persists despite being widely known — partly because it's psychologically hard to execute (you're always buying something that already feels expensive).

## Strategy Types

Three core strategies are the focus for Week 1. Others (funding rate momentum, narrative/sector plays, social sentiment) follow in later weeks.

### 1. Trend-Following / Moving Average Crossovers
A fast MA crossing above a slow MA signals an uptrend; crossing below signals a downtrend.

- Classic: **50/200 MA crossover** (golden cross / death cross) for longer-term trends
- Shorter: **9/21 EMA crossover** for more responsive signals
- Time-series approach — compares an asset's price to its own recent history

> ⚠️ Excels in strongly trending markets but generates frequent false signals in choppy, sideways conditions — which crypto spends significant time in.

### 2. Breakout Momentum
Buying when price clears a significant resistance level (ATH, range highs, key round numbers) on elevated volume.

- Crypto is prone to explosive breakouts due to **short squeeze dynamics** — forced liquidations accelerate the move
- FOMO-driven retail participation typically follows
- Volume confirmation is critical: a breakout on declining volume is a warning sign

### 3. Altcoin Rotation / Cross-Sectional Momentum
Rank assets by recent performance (7d / 30d returns) and rotate capital into the top performers.

- Capital typically flows: **BTC → ETH → large-cap alts → mid-cap alts → small-cap alts**
- Catching rotation early is one of the highest-edge plays in crypto
- Requires active monitoring and fast exits

> Best used for identifying which assets have the most relative strength during a bull market cycle.

## Trading Timeframes

| Timeframe | Approach | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Scalp (1–15 min) | Order flow, tape reading, micro breakouts | Requires automation; fees and slippage eat edges fast |
| Intraday (1–4 hr) | EMA momentum, breakout entries, volume confirmation | Popular with active traders; avoids overnight funding costs on perps |
| Swing (1–14 days) | Trend continuation, altcoin rotation, narrative plays | Best balance of signal quality vs. time commitment |
| Positional (1–3 months) | Macro cycle momentum, BTC dominance, sector rotation | Lower noise; aligned with crypto's 3–4 year halving cycles |
| Cycle (6 months–2 years) | Bull/bear cycle positioning | Buy accumulation, sell euphoria; highest returns but requires conviction through 50%+ drawdowns |

> **Practical sweet spot:** 4-hour to daily chart with a 2–6 week holding period.

## Strategy Types & Indicators

Three core strategies for Week 1. Each is built around a specific set of indicators — understanding *why* each indicator works is as important as knowing how to code it.

---

### 1. Trend-Following / MA Crossovers

**How it works:** A fast moving average crossing above a slow MA signals an emerging uptrend — and vice versa. The logic is that MAs reflect the *average cost* of participants over a period. When short-term average price rises above long-term, recent buyers are in control.

**Why it works:** Exploits the underreaction effect — prices drift gradually as information slowly gets priced in. MAs capture that drift after it's established, trading the middle of the trend.

**Drawbacks:** Lagging by nature — you always enter after the move has started. Gets chopped up badly in sideways markets, generating repeated false signals.

#### 📐 Indicator: Moving Averages (MA)

MAs smooth price data over N periods to filter out short-term noise and reveal the underlying trend direction. The key distinction is *how* recent prices are weighted:

- **SMA** (Simple) — equal weight to all periods. Slower to react, better for identifying major trend structure.
- **EMA** (Exponential) — more weight to recent prices. More responsive to new price action; preferred for momentum signals.

```python
# SMAs — trend structure
df['SMA_50']  = df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['SMA_200'] = df['close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# EMAs — responsive momentum signals
df['EMA_9']  = df['close'].ewm(span=9,  adjust=False).mean()
df['EMA_21'] = df['close'].ewm(span=21, adjust=False).mean()

# Golden cross: fast MA crosses above slow MA → bullish signal
df['signal'] = (df['SMA_50'] > df['SMA_200']).astype(int)

# Or shorter-term with EMAs
df['ema_signal'] = (df['EMA_9'] > df['EMA_21']).astype(int)
```

Common periods: `20` short-term · `50` medium · `200` long-term trend

### 2. Breakout Momentum

**How it works:** Buy when price clears a significant resistance level — ATH, range highs, key round numbers — on elevated volume. The level acts as a compression point; once broken, trapped sellers are cleared out and the path of least resistance opens up.

**Why it works:** Structural — short squeeze dynamics unique to crypto mean concentrated short positions get forcibly liquidated as price rises, mechanically accelerating the move. FOMO-driven retail then follows. The breakout is often self-fulfilling.

**Drawbacks:** Prone to fakeouts — price briefly breaks a level then reverses, triggering stops. Volume confirmation is essential to filter real from false breaks.

#### 📐 Indicator: Volume + OBV + VWAP

Volume tells you *whether* to believe a price move. Real momentum has expanding volume behind it — it shows genuine participation, not just thin-air price movement. Without it, any indicator signal is suspect.

- **OBV** (On-Balance Volume) — running total that adds volume on up days, subtracts on down days. Rising OBV with rising price confirms the trend; divergence (price up, OBV flat/down) is a warning.
- **VWAP** (Volume-Weighted Average Price) — average price weighted by volume. Used as a dynamic support/resistance benchmark, especially intraday. Price reclaiming VWAP after a dip is often a continuation signal.

```python
# Raw volume confirmation — look for expanding volume on breakout candles
df['vol_ma']       = df['volume'].rolling(20).mean()
df['vol_expanding'] = df['volume'] > df['vol_ma']

# On-Balance Volume (OBV)
direction = df['close'].diff().apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 0 else -1)
df['OBV'] = (df['volume'] * direction).cumsum()

# VWAP — intraday benchmark
df['VWAP'] = (df['close'] * df['volume']).cumsum() / df['volume'].cumsum()
```

> ⚠️ A breakout on declining volume is a red flag. High-volume breakouts are far more likely to follow through.

---

### 3. Altcoin Rotation / Cross-Sectional Momentum

**How it works:** Rank assets by recent performance (7d / 30d returns) and rotate capital into the top performers. Rather than comparing an asset to its own history, this compares *relative strength* across assets.

**Why it works:** In bull cycles, capital flows predictably outward: **BTC → ETH → large-cap alts → mid-caps → small-caps**. Momentum in one layer telegraphs what's coming in the next. Cross-sectional ranking captures this rotation systematically.

**Drawbacks:** Requires fast exits — by the time a rotation is obvious, you're often buying the top of that wave. Correlations spike in risk-off moves, so everything falls together and the rotation thesis breaks down.

#### 📐 Indicator: RSI (Relative Strength / Divergence filter)

RSI measures the *speed and magnitude* of recent price changes on a 0–100 scale. It works because it quantifies buying vs selling pressure over a period — not just direction, but how aggressively each side is winning.

In rotation strategies, RSI is most useful as a **filter** to avoid buying assets that are already exhausted, and to spot **divergence** — when price makes a new high but RSI doesn't, momentum is weakening even if price hasn't turned yet.

```python
def compute_rsi(series, period=14):
    delta = series.diff()
    gain  = delta.clip(lower=0).rolling(period).mean()
    loss  = (-delta.clip(upper=0)).rolling(period).mean()
    rs    = gain / loss
    return 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))

df['RSI'] = compute_rsi(df['close'], period=14)

# Use as a filter on rotation entries — avoid assets already overbought
df['rsi_ok'] = df['RSI'] < 70

# Divergence flag: price at new high but RSI is not
df['price_high'] = df['close'] == df['close'].rolling(20).max()
df['rsi_high']   = df['RSI']   == df['RSI'].rolling(20).max()
df['divergence'] = df['price_high'] & ~df['rsi_high']  # potential reversal warning
```

- `> 70` — overbought, potential correction incoming
- `< 30` — oversold, potential bounce
- **Divergence** — price and RSI moving in opposite directions → weakening trend

> RSI divergence is more useful than the absolute levels alone — a strong trend can remain "overbought" for weeks. Use divergence to detect when momentum is secretly fading.

#### 📐 Indicator: MACD (Momentum confirmation across all three strategies)

MACD is useful across all three strategies as a **momentum confirmation layer** — it shows whether the trend has genuine accelerating force behind it, or is running out of steam.

It works by measuring the *gap* between a fast and slow EMA. When that gap is widening, momentum is building. When it's narrowing (histogram contracting), the move is losing steam even if price hasn't reversed.

```python
df['EMA_12']    = df['close'].ewm(span=12, adjust=False).mean()
df['EMA_26']    = df['close'].ewm(span=26, adjust=False).mean()
df['MACD']      = df['EMA_12'] - df['EMA_26']                 # momentum gap
df['Signal']    = df['MACD'].ewm(span=9, adjust=False).mean() # smoothed signal
df['Histogram'] = df['MACD'] - df['Signal']                   # strength of momentum

# Crossover: MACD crossing above signal line = bullish confirmation
df['macd_bull'] = (df['MACD'] > df['Signal']).astype(int)

# Histogram trend — is momentum building or fading?
df['hist_growing'] = df['Histogram'] > df['Histogram'].shift(1)
```

- **MACD Line** = EMA(12) − EMA(26) — the raw momentum reading
- **Signal Line** = EMA(9) of MACD — smoothed trigger
- **Histogram** — expanding = momentum building · contracting = fading
- Crossover: MACD above signal line → bullish | below → bearish

### Indicator Quick Reference

| Indicator | Type | Best Used For | Key Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMA / EMA | Trend | Identifying trend direction, crossover entries | Lagging — always behind price |
| RSI | Momentum oscillator | Divergence detection, avoiding exhausted entries | Can stay extreme for long periods in strong trends |
| MACD | Trend + momentum | Confirming momentum strength, spotting fading moves | Also lagging; noisy on lower timeframes |
| Volume / OBV | Volume | Confirming breakouts, spotting distribution | Doesn't give price direction on its own |
| VWAP | Volume-weighted price | Intraday support/resistance, trend benchmark | Resets daily — less useful for swing/positional |

> No indicator works in isolation. The standard approach is layering: use MA or price structure for *direction*, volume for *confirmation*, and RSI/MACD to gauge *momentum strength* and spot early *exhaustion*.

## Backtesting Framework

### Process
```
In-sample testing → Stress testing → Walk-forward → Paper trading → Live
```

### Data Periods

| Period | Label | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2017–present | Solid | Includes ICO bubble/collapse; additional full cycle |
| 2018–present | Minimum viable | Full cycle: 2018 bear, COVID crash, 2020–21 bull, 2022 bear, 2023–24 recovery |
| Pre-2017 | Supplementary only | Thin liquidity, retail-dominated — do not use as core validation |

### Regime Slicing
Test across each regime deliberately:

| Regime | Periods |
|---|---|
| Bull | 2017, 2020–21 Q4, 2023–24 |
| Bear | 2018, 2022 |
| Choppy/sideways | Much of 2019, mid-2023 |
| Shock events | Mar 2020 (COVID), May 2021 (China ban), May 2022 (LUNA), Nov 2022 (FTX) |

### Walk-Forward Structure
Static backtests overfit. Use walk-forward validation:
- **Training window:** 12–18 months
- **Test window:** 3–6 months
- **Roll:** quarterly

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Profit factor | > 1.5 |
| Max drawdown | < 20% |
| Win rate | > 50% |
| Avg profit | > 1.5R |

### Survivorship Bias (Altcoins)
Coins with long historical data are the ones that *didn't* go to zero. To partially correct:
- Use historical snapshots of market cap rankings, not today's top 50
- Include delisted assets where data is available
- Paid sources (Kaiko, CryptoDataDownload) have more complete datasets than CoinGecko/Messari
